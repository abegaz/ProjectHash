# ProjectHash
The objective of projectHash is to provide data service to convert sensitive data 
into hash codes. It converts a plaintext password into popular hash-based message digest: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA 512.
The code is implemented using JavaFX. The converted hash codes are stored into a file.
This is a starter project and shouldnâ€™t be used in a production environment.
